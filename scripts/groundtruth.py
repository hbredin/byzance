"""Generate groundtruth matrix for initial pre-clustering

A pre-clustering groundtruth matrix G is K x K matrix where K is the number of
pre-clusters, G[i, j] = 1 if all items of pre-clusters i and j are in the same
reference cluster, G[i, j] = 0 if they are in two different reference clusters
and G[i, j] = -1 if at least one of pre-clusters i and j are already not
completely pure.

Usage:
  groundtruth.py <reference.txt> <pre_clustering.txt> <groundtruth.npy>
  groundtruth.py (-h | --help)
  groundtruth.py --version

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.
